      <p>
        SCOPE club is the  technical club of MLRIT that has the motto to
        instill a coding culture, collaborate, and arrange events relevant to
        Open Source, Game Development, Web Development, App Development, and
        many other topics. Many students at the institute are doing well, but
        they can do even more if they get proper guidance. These students
        invariably maintain contact with a select lot of elite, wise seniors who
        act as mentors or friends. The purpose of SCOPE club is to provide an
        official platform for these efforts to encourage them by officially
        endorsing them and helping them surmount the hostel boundaries for a
        healthier and fruitful network.
